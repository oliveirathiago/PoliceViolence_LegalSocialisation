# Police violence and legal socialisation

This repository contains the code to replicate all analyses included the the article:
  
  > Oliveira, Thiago R. and Jon Jackson. Police violence, criminal offending, and the legal socialization of adolescents.

Unfortunately, raw data can only be made available with data agreements. A reduced version of the dataset is available for replication purposes.

### Structure

-   `data` is a directory containing the (hidden) raw datasets, which is then populated with the `data_reduced.RDS` file once `cleaning.R` runs
-   `plots` is an empty directory which is populated when `PanelMatch.R` and `rasch.R` run
-   `cleaning.R` loads the raw survey data and produced `data_reduced.RDS`, which is a clean data set used across all analyses
-   `PanelMatch.R` produces results obtained using Imai et al's (2023) matching methods for panel data
-   `rasch.R` produces results obtained using a hybrid, longitudinal specification of a multinomial Rasch model
-   `PoliceViolence_LegalSocialisation.Rproj` is an R project
